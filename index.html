      <h3>
     1.What horses can eat?
     </h3>

     <main>
        Horses are herbivores and, as such, they need a very specific diet. They must consume lots of fibre to keep 
        their extremely long and sensitive digestive tract working and they must eat little and often, almost all day 
        long. In simple terms, horses eat grass and hay or haylage, but salt, concentrates and fruits or vegetables can  
       also enhance their diets, depending on the required work regime and available feed.Also they can eat some snacks
       (of course not a lot or every day)

          <h5>2.How much do horses live?
           <p>
            The average lifespan of a domesticated horse is 25 to 30 years old. The average for Mustangs and other horses in the wild is typically closer to 15 years. Domesticated horses tend to live longer because veterinarians can address their medical conditions and dietary needs.
           but with proper care, horses can live to be 40, but this is considered way beyond extreme old age. At the age of 36, a horse reaches the equivalent of a 100-year-old person
          </p>
            3.How many foals can a horse have at once?
          <p>
            Horses typically only have one baby at a time. According to the UC Davis Center for Equine Health, most mares will not be able to take two embryos to term, and usually abort during the later stages of the pregnancy. 
           but they can have 0 to 20, with an average broodmare producing around 15 to 20 foals in her life.
          </p>
           4.how many horses are born each a year?
           <p>
            It's challenging to get an exact number, but about 20,000 new foals are born yearly. In high-end Thoroughbred breeding facilities, stallions work hard to cover over a hundred mares during the breeding season.
           </p>
           5.How many horses there is in the world?
           <p>
            The world’s horse population is likely to be around 60 million, according to official figures and estimates, although attempting such a count is undoubtedly the equine equivalent of herding cats.

At the heart of the issue is the way nations count their horses and how their respective agricultural statistics classify the millions of sport and pleasure horses around the globe.

However, an analysis of figures from a variety of sources point to there being around 60 million horses in the world, with evidence suggesting that official figures collated by the United Nations represent an under-estimate.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) estimates that the number of horses in the world is 58,832,221. A full country-by-country breakdown is available in the graphic at the foot of this report
           </p>
           6.Which country had the most horses?
           <p>
            Have you ever wondered just how many horses there are in the world? In many places it’s hard to go a day without seeing at least one, and that’s because the planet is bustling with these beautiful animals. The United Nations use their Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to collect some impressive levels of data, everything from crop production to government expenditure. Live Animal Population is another useful dataset that they’re able to produce, which means that we can put this info into some handy maps that allow you to take a look for yourself. Read on to find out which countries and continents possess the most equines, as well as some other interesting figures about the world’s horse population.

 

            Here are the top 5 nations:
            
            1. USA - 10.26 Million
            
            2. Mexico - 6.35 Million
            
            3. China - 6.02 Million
            
            4. Brazil - 5.25 Million
            
            5. Argentina - 3.60 Milion
           </p>
            7.what are the 3 types of horses?
            <p>
                All horse breeds are classified into three main groups: heavy horses, light horses, and ponies. Heavy horses are the largest horses, with large bones and thick legs. Some weigh more than 2,000 pounds. Light horses are smaller horses, with small bones and thin legs.
                
Most ponies are gentle, easily trained animals that can be used for riding and for pulling or carrying light loads. Pony breeds include the Welsh, Shetland, Hackney, and Connemara.

The Welsh pony was originally bred in Wales to work in the narrow tunnels of coal mines and to herd sheep over hilly farmland. Most Welsh ponies are less than 57 inches in height. Welsh ponies are intelligent, friendly, and athletic. The are easy for children to ride. They are also excellent jumpers at horse shows. Welsh ponies are hardy animals that feel right at home in both cold and hot climates.

The Welsh pony at Big Run Wolf ranch is a gelding—meaning a male that has had its reproductive glands removed to prevent it from breeding.

            8.How much do horses eat per day?
            <p>
              Horses are able to consume about 1.5 to 2% of their body weight in dry feed (feed that is 90% dry matter) each day. As a rule of thumb, allow 1.5 to 2 kg of feed per 100 kg of the horse's body weight. However, it is safer to use 1.7% of body weight (or 1.7 kg per 100 kg of body weight) to calculate a feed budget.
            </p>
            9.Who are horse enemy?
            <p>
              The horse, a prey animal, depends on flight as its primary means of survival. Its natural predators are large animals such as cougars, wolves, or bears, so its ability to outrun these predators is critical.
